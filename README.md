# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Financial losses caused by fraudulent credit card activities are a major problem. Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) requires finding fraudulent transactions out of millions of daily transactions. The ability of ML techniques to effectively address the challenges raised by CCFD has led to a large and growing body of research in the last decade.

## Machine Learning for Fraud Detection

A wide number of ML techniques can be used to address the problem of CCFD. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that contains code for models that might be used to address the problem of CCFD. This project is one of the first projects I have done in the area od data science and machine learning after reading books and watching tutorials.Techniques used in the solution to the problem are common machine learning techniques introduced in various books, courses and tutorials. Also, I have followed the concepts introduced in this book [this book](https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/).
